_Iceland 2015_

July & August 2015

All ideas are planted as small seeds within the vortexes of
the mind, they grow and come to fruition. I write for you now as the seed has grown
to full blossom and now wilts as seasons change. But that's
a good thing, an appreciation of the spectacle. The first thought of Iceland
came many years ago. In truth it came about from a dark place, but light often
does that. 

__

Darkness can't
drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only
love can do that". Martin Luther King Jr. Every good story starts with a journey and this one is no
exception. This is a story of the time a fool hearted man grew up. Lets begin;
I gave up a 10 year dream of being a fully fledged illustrator. For many years
I studied the writings of zen buddhism, I studied daoism and focused myself on letting go.

The career path to be an illustrator
was chosen during my GCSE's. It was not my destiny, that door
was always shut and I spent 10 years knocking, picking and ramming it open. Do
you know the philosopher Alan Watts? He has been my hero since the day I found
his dulcet British tones which simplified the world around me. He lead me into
the teachings of the Dao and Zen Buddhism. At the time I started writing
subconscious poetry and I read deeply into what I was writing; a craftsman who
forces his hand, breaks his tools. I learnt to let go of all binding false
desires with the guidance of an inner knower who held my hand. I knew the world
I was aiming for wasn't the path I was destined.

From 2011 to the start of 2015, life was too heavy upon my
shoulders, like the feeling of carrying a large weight, one day I let go. I
could breathe again. That revelation came only at the darkest point, whilst my
career was tumbling into failure and I was on my 7th London flat in 4 years - I
was alone and exhausted. There was a feeling of walking away from this
oppressive and unwelcome place. I was going to walk away from society, routine,
mediocrity. I was one month away from living a false ideal; I was to walk out
of London like an old style gypsy, a rover, to hitchhike wherever the next car
was going and onwards into an unknown. I had no plan, no direction, no real
hope. (This conflicted against the metaphysical teachings that I had previously
learnt - I was in a tumultuous place of confusion). My vague idea was to walk
and find work wherever one could, at a hostel, a bar, washing cars. It was a
desperate time, but happenstance played a card, a divine intervention; I met a
girl. I stayed in London for a little while longer. In god

'

s
own truth she is the best thing that has happened to me. 

At the time, my job tied me over and I had a spark of love
in my eye yet my inner demons never left, what was I to do with myself? I was
still young I could do something worthwhile, with love and purpose. I knew that
my inner demons were taking over yet I ensured that they were never given the
space to ruin love. Two forces; love and hate, resided in my being. I wasn't
sure what to do, so I turned for advice in the solitary way that I knew how - I
read and I listened.

water, let stand, becomes clear.

Lao Tzu.

I took time for myself to meditate upon life . Although I
kept saying it to myself, I wasn

'

t really grasping the concept of
letting go. I needed to watch the dance between black and white unfold before
me. There was so much joy in the world yet I saw too much pain.

Walking away and giving my life in London time away from me
still needed to happen. The rover in me still pulsed, adventure was calling me
forth and I had to answer. My feet needed boots and my head needed space. I
made a solemn vow to myself that I needed to get out into the world of other to
find self. By then, Charly and I were official. We have this way of being that
is 100% transparent, I know the value of it

'

s
rarity - it is very precious. I was able to tell her that I needed time from
life. Telling her that I planned to go away for a couple of months was hard.
Doing it evermore so.

Why Iceland? .. A population with only 300,000 (Size of the
city of Leicester) I knew I could find the reckless abandonment of silence,
solitude - oh such humble solitude. An island over the sea that is colloquially
known as 

'

The land of fire and ice

'

.
Looking back now, perhaps that is an unconscious metaphor for the turbulence
that I was feeling. The dream was to escape and leave reality behind whilst I
walked off into my created visions of fairies and dragons. I wanted to walk in
the mists, timeless and unstrung, free as if I were air that whistled idly into
the future and took no home upon such mortal plains. I foresaw a version of
life that was an imagined ideal, a dream, for aren

'

t that all we are?

Our revels now are ended. These our

I have always had
faith in my own ability. I once ran the London Marathon without any training.
Stupid I know, I could

'

ve seriously hurt myself. But I
turned up, bright white trainers on toes and I finished with a good time.
Belief does that for you. I had a big goal, it was loosely 

'

to
walk across Iceland

"

. I didn't think of the details, the
aim was just to walk and get so incredibly lost that I find something, anything
that differs from the regular.

William Morris in Iceland: Questions of Travel by Lavinia
Greenlaw is a great read for anyone who is interested in Iceland. I was
inspired by his travels. In the 19th Century however one could sail to Iceland
from Aberdeen, this was my initial sentiment. However it wasn

'

t
to be the case. In retrospect, my planning was shoddy; I winged most of it. But
I had adventure pulling me forward and in truth, the universe has a funny way
of giving you what you need. Things fell in line, I organised unpaid leave from
work for 6 weeks. This shit was real, it was happening. It

'

s
on.

I hate travelling in
a linear passage. I much prefer a circular motion. Completing a circle, for me
enraptures the essence of living. The wheel of life, the turning of the
seasons, what goes around comes around, the windmills of your mind. My route
was of one out of mild stubbornness and belief. Flights to Reykjavik can be
easily bought for 

Â£

299 return, easy jet from Heathrow.
But easy is as easy gets, the reward of accomplishing something challenging
lingers in the soul as echoes after the sweet happening of an event has ended.
I never made the trip complex, it made itself different. It was if I was
bearing witness to the trip creating itself and I was the vessel that it
manifested through. I tried so hard to get a boat from Scotland but alas, I
found myself wanting. After researching all the avenues possible, the only
thing I was able to do was take a ferry from Denmark or the Faroe Islands. Most
people would

'

ve said, take the plane straight there, but I wasn't most
people. I found out that the ferry arrived in East Iceland where no bus tour
traveler does dare to venture. I could complete the circle without double
tracking on myself. It went as such; London Stansted to Aarhus, Denmark (easy
jet), Aarhus to Hirtshals (train), One night stop over and then the ferry in
the morning and at sea for three days to Seydisfjordur, East Iceland via
Torshavn, Faroe Islands. 

In the dim light of Charly

'

s
bedroom, I saw the look of small quiet sadness upon her face. We were
discussing my plans and I sensed a mild fear from a voice of future loneliness
within her. The room was quiet for an idle weekday on Caledonian Road. Absence
makes the heart grow fonder and I knew that I would crave her soft touch of
love in the bleak despairs of an endless journey. In a slight second and on the
spot I visualised that an opportunity was given to me to provide ourselves a
moment where the universe simply stops. A keyframe in the timeline of our lives
could be consciously created out of one question. Would you be my end? I knew
that I could conquer any mountain if she was at the summit. Without any
hesitation we booked her flights to Reykjavik and mine home. A lot like love,
adventure is only realised when one is in the midsts of it and I was swept
without an anchor forwards. The start and end were organised yet I left the
middle of my trip unplanned - I had a date and a location of where to be and I
would meet her there.

How lucky I am to have something that
makes saying goodbye so hard

"

. - Winnie the Pooh 

We said goodbye at St Pancras Station, Kings Cross at an
ungodly hour in the morning. Her mascara ran, my collar was now stained from a
goodbye that lasted an eternity.

Like
the stain I knew this moment would fade, the only permanent is change. We
kissed as if it was our last breathe for life and I went through the barrier to
the 6.05 to London Stansted Airport. I left my lady at the station, it already
felt like a gulf opened up between us yet I was only in the sprawling
suburbs.

In all honesty, the flight to Denmark and the train two
Hirtshals was noteworthy. Denmark was surprisingly warm and looked exactly like
East Anglia. My knowledge of historical geography gave me an expectation for it
to be the case. Hirtshals, a smaller Folkestone has no real need of mention,
neither good or bad; just is. It was a rather tepid beginning, I never felt
like it was a curtain calling crucendo of years of trepidation. Not once did I
sense a kettle drum climax to releasing my old ways of being. But then again,
waves crest only after the slow ebb and draw from land. I was in the process of
equilibrium, I couldn

'

t be pulled back any further as the
incentive has been initiated, the scales were tipping towards a massive rush
forwards.

It took the look of the sea to make me feel this
transition. The Smyril Line ferry was wholesomely full of nationalities and
fortunately I found myself the only brit amongst them. A true feeling of
novelty. I have escaped. To the rear of the Ship did I find some solace and I
was inhibited with the spirit of life. A true testament to the sense that I
felt and what I thought was stabbed with a pen and put to paper in my journal.

_Life_

_often feels
like being at sea._

_We are surrounded by
constant change. We keep moving forward, forward into the void, chasing an
endless horizon. The present is always born from that great void and with that
very thought, it is already the past. Just as the wake which follows the ship. It
constantly trails behind us eventually reaching far enough and so vanishes. It
simply disappears. The past has passed; forgotten by the sun and the sky. _

__

_Therefore the only thing we have, is now. _

__

_Maybe that is why so many of us have an unspoken connection
to music. Music is done simply for itself. It has no purpose but one of life_

'

s
necessities. In the instance that a note has been played it is already the
past. Sit quietly, be in the present moment and you can hear that sound appears
of itself. From a void of silence it simply appears and in that moment it is
gone, now only an echo of a memory and in time, echoes fades. 

__

_With everything so definitely in flux, what do we have to
hold on to?_

_Absolutely nothing._

__

_Thats the nostalgia of the sea traveller, a watery
atmosphere. The journey to embark upon land has an old fashioned, dignified,
fully stated; _

'

I have arrived!

'

Meanwhile
you have time at your leisure, no rush, no distractions from what is actually
happening around you. The slow and steady progress counted by the drifting
landmarks or even the stars. That famous white rail where many a classic film
hero has leant and observed the two shades of blue with no response for his
pensive thoughts. 

__

_That horizon, that endless infinity; meditation and water,
bound for eternity. _

__

_We see ourselves, our souls, in all water; be it rivers or
fountains. We try to grasp at it and the water falls through our mortal
fingers. An arcane phantom of life. _

For three days I travelled on the Smyril Line ferry. I took
the cheapest ticket (don

'

t) to cut corners. It was 6 beds in a
closet room. I shared with men who snored so often and so deeply that the ships
engines were silence in comparison. There are children screaming around. Solid
cabin beds give no peaceful dreams. Sleep comes at a premium price. But who
needs sleep when there is so little to do? I was travelling on a budget, I
forgot about food on the ferry. That also comes at a premium. A hefty premium.
I did however have the fortuity to have ordered la buffet lunch everyday (I
also had a tupperware container) so stacked up for dinner and spent my money on
beer and whiskey both nights and an over priced sad pizza as a treat one day.
But hey, I

'

m on a boat! 

The three days at sea gave more than ample time for
reflection. After two days of beautiful sailing I awake one morning to the
thickest of sea mists. Eeriness beckons across the bulwarks and gangways, the
gentle rocking into oblivion. A calmness on board that infects children and the
elderly alike. Whips of fog roll across the blue floor decking caught only by
the mild sea breeze, no birds fly. There is nothing and us. Timelessness
prevails as we cruise upon our path. I imagine that the captain follows
satellite navigation, bleeps and spurrs of machinery and gadgets that only the
trained eye can understand for it seems we are lost. Stillness takes root in
the base of the spine as the progressional march continues without signs of
ceasing. Alas, out in the distance a shoreline, land, our island. 

Within music the rest is implies the note and here we find
ourselves encompassed by nothing but the patterns of being, the ships rhythmic
engine, the lapping on the side of the boat and my pulse.

Breathing is a tidal rhythm, in and out, do I
do it or does it do me? We traverse closer and closer into a fjord. The mild
merriment of arrival is met by an atmosphere that glistens with mystery and
sheer magic. The bows that were once a party-like scene in Torshavn have now
surrendered and succumbed to a respectful reverence not too dissimilar to
awestruck children. Hazy rain caught in whirling winds whistle with an
unfamiliar song of endless days against the rocks.

A land where spirit reigns king and humble
humans must tred gently. That is until the foghorn of the ship bellows an
almighty blow that reverberates of bare cliff faces which snarl. As if the land
shakes and the gods are summoned; we have arrived.

Seydisfjordur is a small quiet town in the far east of
Iceland. One could walk the entirety (I mean on every street) in an hour at
most. One sweet little church stands centre stage within a valley. A time long
gone si

nce
the harbour towns of Britain once looked like this. I couldn't see further than
the immediate town as the ship came to anchor in the small jettied harbour but
I sensed this is the start of something special. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4226a94e-0305-4ea0-ad02-34c9c0be1f4f.jpg)
